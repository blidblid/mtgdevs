      <b>Power</b> is average pick order. <br>
      If you only picked Black Lotus in vintage cube (lucky!), you'd have a power of 1. <br>
      If you only picked Demolish in WAR-draft, you'd have a power of 264, because there are 264 cards in WAR.

    <div class="mat-caption">
      <b>Mana</b> is standard deviation of your mana symbols. <br>
      If it's high, your mana is all over the place. <br>
      If it's zero, you're playing mono-colored.

    <div class="mat-caption">
      <b>Curve</b> is offset from a perfect curve. <br>
      What is a perfect curve you ask? <br>
      Here, it's just the average from a bunch of limited games.
